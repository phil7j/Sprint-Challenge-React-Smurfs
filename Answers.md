Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing is the old traditional way of browsing the web. When navigation through a website, the screen refreshes each time you go to another page or submit a form. Each time you refresh the server sends you a new set of HTML,CSS and JS to display on the screen.  With the advancement in today's browsers we can now do client-side routing as well. This happens when you are able to navigate to different routes on the website without refreshing the page. The HTML, CSS and JS is loaded at the initial load of website and then the browser handles the navigation to different routes. If you need to access additional data, the browser uses Asynchronous JS to retrieve it and display it.
